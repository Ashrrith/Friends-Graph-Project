# Friends-Graph-Project

Creating an implementation of a graph which graphs a set of friends. Using the graph one can find the shortest path between two students using BFS with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the Flood-fill algorithm to find all students that go to the same school. Utilized DFS algorithm to find articulation points in the graph.
